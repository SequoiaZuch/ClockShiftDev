   - Fallback handling for location errors

2. City Search
   - Real-time search through city database
   - Shows city and country information
   - Quick selection from search results
   - Supports partial name matching
   - Search by city or country

3. Time Comparison
   - Expandable comparison section
   - Reference city (selected from main display)
   - Add multiple cities for comparison (up to 5)
   - Shows time differences relative to reference city
   - Remove individual cities from comparison
   - Set any city as reference with radio buttons

4. Time Conversion
   - Custom date and time input for reference city
   - Support for up to 5 target cities
   - Real-time updates when changing reference time
   - Clear time difference display
   - Reset to current time option
   - Relative time difference calculations

5. Location Detection
   - Automatic local timezone detection
   - Reverse geocoding for city name
   - Fallback handling for location errors
   - Clear error messages and retry option
   - Coordinates display

## Technical Implementation
1. Frontend Framework
   - React with TypeScript
   - Vite for build tooling
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Lucide React for icons
   - DayJS for time manipulation

2. Data Management
   - Supabase for city database
   - Real-time updates using dayjs
   - Timezone calculations and formatting
   - UTC offset parsing and handling
   - Custom time input processing

3. UI Components
   - Responsive layout
   - Smooth transitions
   - Interactive elements with hover states
   - Accessible button and input controls
   - Clear visual hierarchy

4. Current Files Structure

## Database Schema
Cities table with the following fields:
- id (uuid, primary key)
- entry_no (integer)
- country (text)
- state (text)
- city (text)
- timezone (text)
- coordinates (text)
- currency (text)
- details (text)
- other metadata fields

## Current State
- All core functionality is implemented
- UI is polished and responsive
- Error handling is in place
- Time comparisons are working correctly
- City database is populated with major cities worldwide
- Search functionality supports city and state search
- Timezone calculations are accurate and reliable
- Custom time input is fully functional
- Reference city selection is working
- Time difference calculations are accurate

## Next Steps
1. Add working hours management
2. Implement meeting planner
3. Add user preferences storage
4. Implement dark mode
5. Add export functionality
6. Enhance mobile responsiveness
7. Add offline support
8. Implement caching
9. Add unit tests
10. Add integration tests

## Technical Debt
1. Optimize city search performance
2. Implement error boundaries
3. Add loading states
4. Improve type safety
5. Add input validation
6. Implement form handling
7. Add accessibility features
8. Implement SEO
9. Add analytics
10. Add logging

## Known Issues
1. Edge cases in time conversion need handling
2. City search could be more efficient
3. Mobile navigation needs improvement
4. Error messages could be more user-friendly
